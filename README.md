<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>Nice to see you! What i want to do is to give a simple guide to a complete free ecosystem along the lines of Apple an Microsoft. Lets call it the VEcosystem.</p>
<p>First we want to make the goals clear. Then we wanna find out what parts of our digital live are affected. Last we want to talk solutions.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this endevour is to have a comparable ecosystem in function AND comfort to the know ones by big tech without the drawbacks. For this i try to find easy real-life-applicable solutions to our digital needs. That means usage of banking apps, common messengers etc. are allowed.</p>
<p>The following dimensions are my Rules:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Core and Comfort Functionality should be comparable</li>
  <li>Ease of use should be good</li>
  <li>Interoperability with the whole VEcosystem should be given</li>
  <li>Data security should be a given</li>
  <li>Price should be reasonable</li>
</ol>

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<p>Our digital lifes became quite complex in the recent years. For me, the following "big things" are important: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Smartphone</li>
  <li>Desktop and Notebook</li>
  <li>Cloud computing</li>
  <li>Online Services</li>
</ul>
<p><i>A comment about tech companies</i>: The most difficult question i have come across in my endevour is "Can i trust this company? And is my trust worth it?". The perfect answer to my following quest of taking data security serious is: Hosting everything myself. But lets be honest, often times this is not applicable for real world usage, especially with things like a mail-server. You depend on another company, an entity you don't know. </p>
<p>  There are companies that give you services free of charge (Google first and foremost) that in return use your data. Google gives you a long catalogue to manage the usage of your data (Hier noch link einf√ºgen) and is watched by many NPOs/NGOs etc.. Unless you are implying bad intentions, which most of us do, you get free services for data.</p>
<p>  On the other hand, there are companies like Proton that charge a price but promise great data security. Most of these companies are small and we're implying good intentions. Still, paying money doesn't free them from being/becoming bad actors or still sell, save or copy your data. You still need to trust the company, and i'm not sure it they're trustable. They need a large sum of money to operate, too, after all.</p>

<h3>Smartphone</h3>
<p>Choise of OS: The smartphones of today really don't allow for much variance. There are 2 main systems that are worth the hassle: Android and iOS. I will rule out other linux-based OSes because of rule 1 and 2.</p>
