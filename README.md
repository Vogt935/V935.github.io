<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>Nice to see you! What i want to do is to give a simple guide to a complete free ecosystem along the lines of Apple an Microsoft. Lets call it the VEcosystem.</p>
<p>First we want to make the goals clear. Then we wanna find out what parts of our digital live are affected. Last we want to talk solutions.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this endevour is to have a comparable ecosystem in function AND comfort to the know ones by big tech without the drawbacks. For this i try to find easy real-life-applicable solutions to our digital needs. That means usage of banking apps, common messengers etc. are allowed.</p>
<p>The following dimensions are my Rules:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Core and Comfort Functionality should be comparable</li>
  <li>Ease of use should be good</li>
  <li>Interoperability with the whole VEcosystem should be given</li>
  <li>Data security should be a given</li>
  <li>Price should be reasonable</li>
</ol>

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<p>Our digital lifes became quite complex in the recent years. For me, the following "big things" are important: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Smartphone</li>
  <li>Desktop and Notebook</li>
  <li>Cloud computing</li>
  <li>Online Services</li>
</ul>
<p><i>A comment about tech companies</i>: The most difficult question i have come across in my endevour is "Can i trust this company? And is my trust worth it?". The perfect answer to my following quest of taking data security serious is: Hosting everything myself. But lets be honest, often times this is not applicable for real world usage, especially with things like a mail-server. You depend on another company, an entity you don't know. </p>
<p>  There are companies that give you services free of charge (Google first and foremost) that in return use your data. Google gives you a long catalogue to manage the usage of your data (Hier noch link einfügen) and is watched by many NPOs/NGOs etc.. Unless you are implying bad intentions, which most of us do, you get free services for data.</p>
<p>  On the other hand, there are companies like Proton that charge a price but promise great data security. Most of these companies are small and we're implying good intentions. Still, paying money doesn't free them from being/becoming bad actors or still sell, save or copy your data. You still need to trust the company, and i'm not sure it they're trustable. They need a large sum of money to operate, too, after all.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Smartphone</h3>
<p>Like with the PCs down the line, the question of smartphones is twofold: What OS is used and what apps on that OS. The OS is the most integral part, as it is <b>THE</b> one point of failure of every hardware: Its nice that you use private data apps if the one handling every datastream, every input and output is totally controlled by a big tech company.</p>
<p><b>Choise of OS</b>: The smartphones of today really don't allow for much variance. There are 2 main systems that are worth the hassle: Android and iOS. I will rule out other linux-based OSes because of rule 1 and 2. So in the end, we're between a rock and a hard place!</p>
<p><i>Android:</i> Android is controlled by Google and its "Play Services". Most Android smartphones also use Google Appls like GBoard, Calendar, Telephone, Messages. None of these apps are sure NOT to leak information to Google. The Play services are integral to the usage of Android, they handle the apps (Play Store) and many Android apps outright depend on them.</p>
