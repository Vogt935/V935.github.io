<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>Nice to see you! What i want to do is to give a simple guide to a complete free ecosystem along the lines of Apple an Microsoft. Lets call it the VEcosystem.</p>
<p>First we want to make the goals clear. Then we wanna find out what parts of our digital live are affected. Last we want to talk solutions.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this endevour is to have a comparable ecosystem in function AND comfort to the know ones by big tech without the drawbacks. For this i try to find easy real-life-applicable solutions to our digital needs. That means usage of banking apps, common messengers etc. are allowed.</p>
<p>The following dimensions are my goalposts:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Functionality</li>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
  <li>Interoperability with the whole VEcosystem</li>
  <li>Data security</li>
  <li>Price</li>
</ul>

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<p>Our digital lifes became quite complex in the recent years</p>
